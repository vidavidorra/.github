## Usage

### Reusable GitHub Action workflows

Most of the workflows in the [`.github/workflows`](.github/workflows) folder are reusable workflows. Please see each individual workflow file for it's specific usage and possible inputs. The following example shows the most basic usage in the `lint` job, as well as a little bit more advance usage, with workflow inputs, in the `build` job. Please see the [Calling a reusable workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/reusing-workflows#calling-a-reusable-workflow) section of the [**GitHub**][github] documentation for more details.

```yml
jobs:
  lint:
    uses: vidavidorra/.github/.github/workflows/node-lint.yml
  build:
    strategy:
      matrix:
        nodeVersion: [18, 20]
    uses: vidavidorra/.github/.github/workflows/node-build.yml
    with:
      nodeVersion: ${{ matrix.nodeVersion }}
```

### Renovate
